I try to look around to find more to see how many people are victims of the case, and learn about the behavior and eyes of people around to locate suspicious people. I did not have close access to the area of the scene because the police had completely blocked off after that so I could only observe from a distance. It was difficult to find out who the killer was because the crowd had surrounded the area close to the scene with so many people. So it needs more time to find the relevant clues.
