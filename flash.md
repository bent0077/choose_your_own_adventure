I can't continue chatting at that moment with the horror of the event, so I get up from the table and go out to the scene, wondering what's going on there. First, I check if there is anyone who needs urgent help, and I call the ambulance and the police. While wondering who or what has caused this chaos, I worry that if I get caught using my powers, bad things may happen to me in the future and my life may be turned upside down. If I help, bad things can happen to me, but if I don't, I will regret it for the rest of my life. Shortly after going back and forth between these two opinions, I decide to solve the case and take this risk and try to use my powers without being caught by anyone. I take flight over a secluded corner, quickly observing the building's surroundings, trying to catch clues related to the event. If something catches my eye at that moment, for example, a suspicious individual, I descend without waiting and I run after it quickly. Even though I'm in front of people here, thanks to my speed, people from outside will see me as just a line of light, just like the Flash hero in The Flash series, and no one will be able to identify my identity. I'm able to return to the cafe without my friends knowing.
