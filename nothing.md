A crowd of terrified civilians swarm into the coffee shop to escape the madness. They packed the Cafe in a matter of minutes before the owner locked the door, preventing more people from coming in. Screaming pedestrians were pounding at the door, begging to be let in, but to no avail. Sitting in my seat, I still don't know what is happening. I look out the same window, watching the madness. Maybe the perpetrator will reveal themselves. In the mob of people, there's a man who stands out. He's standing there a few feet away, looking right at me. My heart races from anxiety, with millions of questions running through my head. Who is he? Why isn't he running like everyone else? Why is he staring at me?
