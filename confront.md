The strange man disappeared before I could process everything. Too many people were blocking the door, so I snuck out the back with no one noticing. I quickly started scanning the scene, looking for the mysterious man. People are still running for their lives, but I don’t find a visible threat. I follow where the crowd is running from. Maybe I will find out what is going on. A beam of red light hits the ground just inches away from my feet. It’s the man, floating hundreds of feet in the air, shooting lasers out of his eyes. He’s able to cut buildings in half with no resistance. I’m at a loss. I don't know what to do.
