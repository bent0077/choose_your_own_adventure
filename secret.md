Everyone was panicked, I stopped the conversation to run outside to see what happened. The buildings were constantly falling and flattened all cars parked on the side of the road made all pedestrians in danger. I am very scared at that moment, I want to help people but I know that if I use my superpower now, I will soon be arrested for government experiments. But those pedestrians are very pitiful, they ran with all their might, screaming for help, they need me. I activated my super energy and ran quickly to help. I weaved my way through the small nooks and crannies, rescuing them one by one to safety. Once everyone was safe, I quickly headed back to the cafe with my friends, hoping no one would recognize me. We returned home, I didn't know how to tell my parents because I was afraid they would worry about me. Should I keep it a secret or should I let them know everything?
